# Team Profile Generator

## The Task

To create a command line program that allows you to generate HTML team profile. We also used JEST to test this application.

This project allowed me to learn more about the following;
- Javascript implimentation and use
- The ability to take a set of criteria and create a website that follows those criteria
- A deeper understanding of modules and how they interact with each other.
- A deeper understanding of testing and the JEST module
- A deeper understanding of Javascript and it things you can do with it

## Installation and Usage

A video of the testing and usage was also taken and can be found <a src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1To8RcPJ_0bVb4t0rveIg-VIk7JcYKk4x/view">here</a>.
